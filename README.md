# shootingMethodPlot

This main branch is going to eventually do RK4 with selectable potentials. Right now it's broken.

The shootingMethodDumbGUI branch will plot the functional for the infinite square well potential, it is not possible to select a different potential yet, so the user selectable fields on the right don't actually do anything.
